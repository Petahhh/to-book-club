# Overview

* many tech companies define two tracks for engineers:
  * individual contributor (IC):
    * technical track, no direct reports
  * management track:
    * less technical as you advance and you can move up the ladder of managing engineers, managers, senior managers etc
* **staff plus**
  * there are various criteria across companies for "seniors" and other title
  * staff is a common title that follows senior which leadership does not expect everyone to reach this promotion
    * i.e. a manager doesn't have the expectation that all their senior engineers will eventually be promoted to staff
  * after this point there is various nomeclature for titles beyond this point which may include:
    * principal, distinguished
    * combinations of "senior" + above
 
## Staff Engineer Archetypes
 
* some companies only have management as a career progress for seniors engineers
* those who have staff plus roles have different needs for technical leaders
* the following archetypes help generalize the 4 ways staff plus can operate

* most common archetype
* often a team member who's a subject matter expert in a complex area of the codebase
* works closely with product to plan roadmaps
* provides leadership across a small cluster of teams
* will spend less time coding than before becoming staff
* can be seen as a progression from tech lead role

```

* increasingly less common in companies
* often a domain expert in a complex area vital to the business (storage, cloud infrastructure, API)
* sometimes born out of the need to pay down technical debt accrued from moving fast to find product-market fit
* sometimes expected to be deeply familiar with the codebase, other times explicitly expected not to code
* there may be a history / bad reputation that architects design a system and throw it over the wall for others to implement
  * instead good architects are collaborators with leaders and
