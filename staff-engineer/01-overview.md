# Overview

* many tech companies define two tracks for engineers:
  * individual contributor (IC):
    * technical track, no direct reports
  * management track:
    * less technical as you advance and you can move up the ladder of managing engineers, managers, senior managers etc
* **staff plus**
  * there are various criteria across companies for "seniors" and other title
  * staff is a common title that follows senior which leadership does not expect everyone to reach this promotion
    * i.e. a manager doesn't have the expectation that all their senior engineers will eventually be promoted to staff
  * after this point there is various nomeclature for titles beyond this point which may include:
    * principal, distinguished
    * combinations of "senior" + above
 
## Staff Engineer Archetypes
 
* some companies only have management as a career progress for seniors engineers
* those who have staff plus roles have different needs for technical leaders
* the following archetypes help generalize the 4 ways staff plus can operate
