# Overview

* many tech companies define two tracks for engineers:
  * individual contributor (IC):
    * technical track, no direct reports
  * management track:
    * less technical as you advance and you can move up the ladder of managing engineers, managers, senior managers etc
* **staff plus**
  * there are various criteria across companies for "seniors" and other title
  * staff is a common title that follows senior which leadership does not expect everyone to reach this promotion
    * i.e. a manager doesn't have the expectation that all their senior engineers will eventually be promoted to staff
  * after this point there is various nomeclature for titles beyond this point which may include:
    * principal, distinguished
    * combinations of "senior" + above
 
## Staff Engineer Archetypes
 
* some companies only have management as a career progress for seniors engineers
* those who have staff plus roles have different needs for technical leaders
* the following archetypes help generalize the 4 ways staff plus can operate

|                 |                |
|    Tech Lead    |     Solver     |
|                 |                |

|    Architect    |   Right Hand   |

### Tech Lead

|    Tech Lead    |----------------|
|                 |----------------|
+----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
+----------------------------------+
```

* most common archetype
* often a team member who's a subject matter expert in a complex area of the codebase
* works closely with product to plan roadmaps
* provides leadership across a small cluster of teams
* will spend less time coding than before becoming staff
* can be seen as a progression from tech lead role

### Architect

```

|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
+----------------------------------|
|                 |----------------|
|    Architect    |----------------|
|                 |----------------|
+----------------------------------+
```

* increasingly less common in companies
* often a domain expert in a complex area vital to the business (storage, cloud infrastructure, API)
* sometimes born out of the need to pay down technical debt accrued from moving fast to find product-market fit
* sometimes expected to be deeply familiar with the codebase, other times explicitly expected not to code
* there may be a history / bad reputation that architects design a system and throw it over the wall for others to implement
  * instead good architects have a strong understanding of both business needs and technical constraints and factor them into identifying and solving higher level problems

### Solver

```

+----------------------------------+
```

* less focused on specific tech stack but instead expected to be flexible to address whatever the painpoints in the organization
  * a potential source of frustation is that they are expected to focus on a hot spot until it is contained and may never completely eradictate an issue
    * in addition because they move on, the teams they work with are "left" with finishing up or living with the "solved problem" 
  * paintpoints specifically being areas leadership has identified as critical with either unclear apparoch of high risk in execution
* more often found at companies that are less team centric and more individual focused

### Right Hand

```
+----------------------------------+
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------+
|-----------------|                |
|-----------------|   Right Hand   |
|-----------------|                |
+----------------------------------+
```

* least common archetype
* an organization's senior leader with no reports who's closely aligned with the leader's values and vision
  * a kin to "hand of the King" in Game of Thrones
  * they go off and solve fires and quickly move on as soon as they're solved
* focus is on the leader's objectives and tactically removing barriers and obstacles to achieve them
  * scope of work may not just be technical, it could be people problems, organizational, etc

## Which Archetype is for you?

* the recommendation is to understand what energizes you and what role is available at the company
* tech lead and architect tend to work with the same group of people over a long period of time and develop a sense of team
  * their problem space fall in and out of the leadership's top priority 
* solver and right hand tend to bounce from fire to fire
  * consistently tightly aligned with leadership's top priority
  * less "sense of community"
  * more likely than the other two to be recognized for their impacts
* in the span of a 30-40 year career, you'll get to try a bit of each so picking one isn't a commitment
