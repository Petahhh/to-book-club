# Overview

* many tech companies define two tracks for engineers:
  * individual contributor (IC):
    * technical track, no direct reports
  * management track:
    * less technical as you advance and you can move up the ladder of managing engineers, managers, senior managers etc
* **staff plus**
  * there are various criteria across companies for "seniors" and other title
  * staff is a common title that follows senior which leadership does not expect everyone to reach this promotion
    * i.e. a manager doesn't have the expectation that all their senior engineers will eventually be promoted to staff
  * after this point there is various nomeclature for titles beyond this point which may include:
    * principal, distinguished
    * combinations of "senior" + above
 
## Staff Engineer Archetypes
 
* some companies only have management as a career progress for seniors engineers
* those who have staff plus roles have different needs for technical leaders
* the following archetypes help generalize the 4 ways staff plus can operate

```
+-----------------+----------------+
|                 |                |
|    Tech Lead    |     Solver     |
|                 |                |
+----------------------------------+
|                 |                |
|    Architect    |   Right Hand   |
|                 |                |
+-----------------+----------------+
```

### Tech Lead

```
+----------------------------------+
|                 |----------------|
|    Tech Lead    |----------------|
|                 |----------------|
+----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
+----------------------------------+
```

* most common archetype
* often a team member who's a subject matter expert in a complex area of the codebase
* works closely with product to plan roadmaps
* provides leadership across a small cluster of teams
* will spend less time coding than before becoming staff
* can be seen as a progression from traditional tech lead role
  * tech lead role being the role an engineer takes on within sprint oriented teams (e.g. a senior engineer can be designated as the tech lead of a team but not a staff eng by title and not the tech lead archetype)

### Architect

```
+----------------------------------+
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
+----------------------------------|
|                 |----------------|
|    Architect    |----------------|
|                 |----------------|
+----------------------------------+
```

* increasingly less common in companies
* often a domain expert in a complex area vital to the business (storage, cloud infrastructure, API)
* sometimes born out of the need to pay down technical debt accrued from moving fast to find product-market fit
* sometimes expected to be deeply familiar with the codebase, other times explicitly expected not to code
* there may be a history / bad reputation that architects design a system and throw it over the wall for others to implement
  * instead good architects have a strong understanding of both business needs and technical constraints and factor them into identifying and solving higher level problems

### Solver

```
+----------------------------------+
|-----------------|                |
|-----------------|     Solver     |
|-----------------|                |
|----------------------------------+
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
+----------------------------------+
```

* less focused on specific tech stack but instead expected to be flexible to address whatever the painpoints in the organization
  * a potential source of frustation is that they are expected to focus on a hot spot until it is contained and may never completely eradictate an issue
    * in addition because they move on, the teams they work with are "left" with finishing up or living with the "solved problem" 
  * paintpoints specifically being areas leadership has identified as critical with either unclear apparoch of high risk in execution
* more often found at companies that are less team centric and more individual focused

### Right Hand

```
+----------------------------------+
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------|
|----------------------------------+
|-----------------|                |
|-----------------|   Right Hand   |
|-----------------|                |
+----------------------------------+
```

* least common archetype
* an organization's senior leader with no reports who's closely aligned with the leader's values and vision
  * a kin to "hand of the King" in Game of Thrones
  * they go off and solve fires and quickly move on as soon as they're solved
* focus is on the leader's objectives and tactically removing barriers and obstacles to achieve them
  * scope of work may not just be technical, it could be people problems, organizational, etc

## Which Archetype is for you?

* the recommendation is to understand what energizes you and what role is available at the company
* tech lead and architect tend to work with the same group of people over a long period of time and develop a sense of team
  * their problem space fall in and out of the leadership's top priority 
* solver and right hand tend to bounce from fire to fire
  * consistently tightly aligned with leadership's top priority
  * less "sense of community"
  * more likely than the other two to be recognized for their impacts
* in the span of a 30-40 year career, you'll get to try a bit of each so picking one isn't a commitment

## Does title matter?

Yes and here’s why.

### Informal gauges of seniority

* Term coined by Nelson Elhage
* Measuring merit is hard

> Gauges are believed to evaluate ideas objectively, their sheer informality becomes a broad vector of bias and often conflate confidence with confidence

* The title means you may not need to work as hard as you do to repeatedly prove your technical competence, especially if you do not visually fit the bill

### Being in the room

* one of the advantages of being staff is that you are in the room when decisions are made in the early phases
  * your input can be easily incorporated when you're in the room early
  * otherwise your input, though valid and impactful, may get dismissed because it arrived too late to the party

### Compensation 

* often times, but not always, the staff title will come with a pay bump
* not all companies practice this but you can certainly navigate to the companies that pay staff better

### Access to interesting work

Being staff may mean access to interesting work, for example in the solver role. However this is not always the case. It is **more effective to be hired to work on more interesting things.** Often times the more interesting work doesn’t align with business outcomes and at this level you should not be taking these opportunities. Instead, these interesting projects that are valuable to the business may be more impactful for another engineer who will benefit from it more than you. And as a staff engineer you should be making those sacrifices or choices

### Different rather than better

Becoming staff may be a pitfall. It is not uncommon for people to become staff and do less of what excites them. It is recommended to fully understand the type of work that energizes you so you don’t end up in a role that doesn’t make you happy


### Material but not magic

The title doesn’t automatically give you the social capital to call the shots. You are much better off working on collaborating, listening and other skills to help influence decisions. Perhaps if you are on the edge of becoming staff, the title will be helpful and push you past that point. The one exception is that women and minorities tend to get challenged or questioned about their technical abilities more often and this title can help with that.

## What do staff engineers actually do?

Senior engineers do less coding and more leadership work depending on the archetype 

## Setting technical direction

> Part time product manager for technology

* Tries to help a group of engineers focus in on an ideal state of code quality / architecture and puts together a pragmatic plan to move towards that vision whether they ever fully realize that vision in entirety or not

> Folks who successfully advance technology are pragmatic, deliberate, and focus more ont he long-term trend of progress than viewing each individual decision as a make-or-break criss

* At this level you’re accountable to the business and must solve real needs and not advance your agenda based on ideals or fun pet projects. Advocating for a technical direction needs to provide value and can’t just be for fun or your personal interests which was easier to do as senior.

### Mentorship and sponsorship 

> You're far more likely to change your company's long-term trajectory by growing the engineers around you than thorugh personal heroics

* Heroicism is not expected of staff, instead powering up those around you.

* Pitfall: don’t do the dance to hit this checkbox because it is a source of truly high impact work.

* Mentorship is good and doing more sponsorship is even better. 

> putting your thumb directly on the scale to help advance and support those around you

### Providing Engineering Prospective

Staff engineers get pulled into conversations to help make high level decisions. More concretely, there are situations where decisions are made by leaders and an engineering perspective will improve the outcome before it’s too hard to change. 
* Eg
  * hiring staff plus
  * agreeing to a new customer contract that has hard to spot engineering complexities and gotchas
  * road mapping 

### Exploration 

> In the long term companies either learn to explore, or they fade away; this isn’t an ignorable challenge

Staff engineers may be asked to go on explorations for a few months to see what they can learn. The exploration can range from solving an impending technical road blocker or optimizing a foreseeable scaling problem or stretching the capability of existing tools. 

This work is rewarding and risky. High trust and respect is needed in staff engineers such that there is recognition that the failure and success of the exploration is a reflection of the problem not the engineer 

### Being glue 

Glue work: Invisible not glamorous work that ensures the team is successful and shipping. See [Tanya Reilly blog post](https://noidea.dog/glue)

### Do they still write code?

Based on the sections above it depends. Some prioritize maintaining the “hand to keyboard” practice to stay sharp while others rely on their teams to gain on the ground information. Sometimes you’re off building a prototype or doing sql to better understand user behaviour. In summary :

> Most write some, some write none, but none write as much as they used to earlier in their career

And if you’re doing a lot of coding on a regular basis it may be a sign that you’re “working on something comfortable rather than important”

### Slow but rewarding

The feedback cycle is really slow compared to coding. Easy to feel like you didn’t do anything productive
