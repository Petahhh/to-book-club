## Writing engineering strategy 

A good engineering strategy is both boring and easy to write.

Strategy and vision requires a lot of iteration from the ground up. Resist the urge to bring your brilliant ideas to life. Instead do the exercise of putting those brilliant ideas to paper and letting them go by hitting the delete button. The vision and strategy should come from

### When and why

What is a design doc?

> Strategies or tools of proactive alignment that empower teams to move quickly and with confidence

Strategies allows large groups to make decisions quickly and with confidence because they can draw from the strategy. They can also be used as a basis for the vision. Setting a vision is an investment that is worth making. A good signal that it’s time to write a strategy is when you keep revisiting the same debate over and over. On the flipside, it is fine not to define a strategy or vision if the above problems are not happening. 

### Write five design docs

> A good design document describes a specific problem, surveys possible solutions, and explains the selected approach’s details.

Here are some signals to look out for when a design talk would be valuable:
* A project will be used by numerous future projects
* The project has meaningful impact on the users
* Work that takes more than a month engineering time

The value of a design docs makes it harder to be misaligned on a strategy because specific solutions are outlined

Here are some tips for writing them:

* **Start from the problem**. A problem well defined as a problem half solved

* **Keep the template simple.** With too many specifications for a design doc, you will deter people from writing them. It’s better to keep it simple and allow people to opt in for whatever attributes they find meaningful for their objectives. 

* **Gather and review together, write alone.** 
 
> It’s usually harder to edit a group document into clear writing than to identify one author to write a clear document

Gather perspectives from others, particularly those who will consume the outcomes of the doc. Be wary of falling in love with any particular solution until after you get peer review. 

* **Prefer good over perfect**. The practice of writing design docs will be more impactful when the good docs are in front of people sooner than being delayed for perfection. It can be toxic to push design doc standards higher and higher as a senior person. 

Generally speaking, the more you write the better you will get at it. As a recommendation, review the doc after it has been implemented and notice the deviations from it and reality. 

### Synthesize those five design docs into a strategy. 

Review your design documents and consider the controversial decisions that came out of them. Base your strategy on past decisions and your learnings from them.

> Good strategies guide trade-offs and explain the rationale behind that guidance. Bad strategies state a policy without explanation, which decouples them from the context they were made.

Advice for writing strategy document:

* **Start where you are**. You may not have all the information, what you write may be bad and need to change but do it anyways. 

* **Write the specifics.**

> Specific statements create alignment; generic statements create the illusion of alignment

* **Be opinionated**. Good strategies are opinionated which enable decision making

* **Show your work**. Showing your work provides confidence to your strategy and allow people to modify and extend your initial work

> As we leave behind the idea of strategy as demonstrations of brilliance, we can start to write far more of them, and we can write them more casually

Strategies are supposed to be tools that enable decision making. Research powers the strategies allowing day-to-day decision-makers to reference them and use them as guides as they come across unforeseen decision points. In theory, this simplifies, or reduces cognitive overhead for engineers to execute on their challenges and tickets. 

### Extrapolate five strategies into a vision

An engineering vision comes from extrapolating the trade-offs played out over many years from a set of strategies. A clear vision makes it easy to understand the strategies when they may contradict each other and also simplifies the process of writing your strategies going into the future. 

Here are some tips for writing visions:
* Write 2 to 3 years out. 
* Ground in your business and your users. 
* Be optimistic rather than audacious. 
* Stay concrete and specific. 
* Keep it 1 to 2 pages long. 

After creating strategies and visions you will want to share it out widely. Don’t be turned off when the response is muted. That’s OK because the audience for your vision or people writing strategies which is a small group. 

> A great vision is usually so obvious that it bores more than it excites

Don’t measure the success of your vision by the excitement it generates. Instead look at how well design docs are written 2 to 3 years out. If an improvement is clear then your vision was good.
