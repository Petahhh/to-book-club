# Operatoring at Staff

There are a lot of meetings for a staff engineer. So if you thought management wasn’t for you because of the meetings, staff will not be much different.

One of the biggest changes in this role is you have much longer feedback cycles. In addition, you will do more work that felt like auxiliary work as a senior.

## Work on what matters

As you advance in your career, the amount of time you have to work shrinks while the impact that is expected of you increases.

>only through pacing your career to your life can you sustain yourself for the long term

Here are some pitfalls to avoid:

### Avoid snacking

Snacks are low impact and low effort activities that feel satisfying. Though it may feel psychologically rewarding, the work that doesn’t push your learning is better saved for someone who will find it to be a great developmental opportunity. 

Balance is key here.

### Stop preening

This is low impact but high visibility work.

> many companies conflate high visibility and high impact so strongly that they can’t distinguish between preening and impact

The caveat here is you must adapt to the way your company operates. If they reward preening then you must do so. But in doing so, you are doing a disservice to your growth. One should keep this in mind when considering joining a company. What behaviour do they reward/incentivize?

### Stop chasing ghosts

> The ghost of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential

Take time to understand the problem at hand because relying on simply what others have identified as problems may be low impact work. 

### Existential issues

First and foremost, if the existence of the company is under threat, whether financial issues or scaling issues, focus on that first. 

### Work where there is room and attention

Sometimes the top priority is clear and everyone is working towards it. But there is opportunity to have high impact in areas that has room to grow. For example, working on an issue that will be an upcoming challenge that not everyone sees right now. Or areas that are doing OK but you are able to make them great. Sometimes this is inclusion work or glue work. 

> teaching a company to value some thing it doesn’t care about is the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less. 

### Foster growth
Boosting up others around you is Low hanging fruit for having high impact. 

> It is quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten

### Finish things

> we only get value from finishing projects, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage.

Help those around you finish projects with your coaching and guidance. Sometimes projects can cross the finish line when the scope is reworked or the right friction points are addressed. As a staff engineer you should be providing that guidance by drawing from your past experience. 

### What only you can

Focus on doing work that is uniquely yours to be done. Do not factor in the fact you may be the fastest for the task or you're more interested in an area. Instead do work that will not happen if __you__ do not do it. This is the vital work a staff engineer should prioritize

### Why it matters

When you’re interviewing for new roles it is not possible to fully communicate the impact of your work. The interview process is a human process and very subjective. That is why it is really important to do valuable work that grows you and your experience which can be used to back up your claims during an interview.
